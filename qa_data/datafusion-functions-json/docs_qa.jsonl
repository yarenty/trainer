{"question": "What is the purpose of the `register_all` method and how can it be used to add these JSON functions to a DataFusion session?", "answer": "The `register_all` method is used to register all the scalar functions defined in the `datafusion_functions_json` crate. These functions allow you to query JSON strings directly in SQL queries.\n    \n    To use these functions, you need to call the `register_all` method on a mutable context object, like this:\n    \n    ```rust\n    let ctx = SessionContext::new();\n    datafusion_functions_json::register_all(&mut ctx)?;\n    ```\n\n    This will add all the JSON functions to the session context. You can then use these functions in your SQL queries by calling them as regular scalar functions.\n    \n    For example, if you have a JSON string like this:\n    ```json\n    {\"name\": \"John\", \"age\": 30}\n    ```\n    \n    You can query it using the `JSON_EXTRACT` function like this:\n    ```sql\n    SELECT JSON_EXTRACT($json, '$.name') FROM my_table;\n    ```\n\n    This will extract the value of the `\"name\"` key from the JSON string and return it as a scalar value.\n\n    Best practices: Make sure to handle errors properly when registering the functions or using them in your queries. Also, be aware that some SQL dialects might not support all the features provided by DataFusion.\n    \n    Common pitfalls: If you forget to register the functions before trying to use them, you'll get an error saying that the function doesn't exist. Make sure to check if the context object is mutable and if it's properly registered before using these functions.\n    \n    Related concepts: You might also want to look into other DataFusion functions for querying JSON strings, like `JSON_QUERY` or `JSON_PATH`. These functions provide more advanced ways of extracting data from JSON strings.\n### End", "source_file": "/home/jaro/trainer/sources/datafusion-functions-json/README.md", "source_repo": "datafusion-functions-json", "generated_at": "2025-07-09T09:53:27.034339"}
{"question": "What is the difference between `json_contains` and using a regular expression to search for a key-value pair in a JSON document, and when would I choose one over the other?", "answer": "The `json_contains` function is specifically designed for searching within JSON documents, whereas using a regular expression can be more versatile but also less efficient.\n    \n    To illustrate this, let's consider an example. Suppose we want to find all documents in our table where the value of the key `a` contains the string `'1'`.\n    \n    Using `json_contains`, we would use the following query:\n    ```sql\n    SELECT id, json_contains(json_col, '{ \"a\": 1 }') as contains_a FROM test_table;\n    ```\n\n    On the other hand, using a regular expression (with the `~` operator in PostgreSQL), we would use the following query:\n    ```sql\n    SELECT id, json_col ~ '^\"{[^\"]*}1[^\"]*\"}' as contains_a FROM test_table;\n    ```\n    \n    Both queries will produce the same result: all documents where the value of the key `a` is equal to `'1'`.\n    \n    However, for more complex searches (e.g., searching for a string within another string), using a regular expression can be more effective.\n    \n    Best practice: Use `json_contains` when you want to perform simple key-value pair searches and use a regular expression when you need to search for more complex patterns.\n    \n    Important considerations:\n    \n    - Be aware that the performance characteristics of `json_contains` versus regular expressions may vary depending on your specific database schema and query patterns.\n    - Regular expressions can be more flexible, but also more resource-intensive. Consider using caching or indexing if you plan to use them frequently.\n    \n    Related concepts:\n    \n    - The [JSON data type](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype-json.html) in PostgreSQL\n    - Regular expression syntax and usage in SQL databases (e.g., [PostgreSQL's `~` operator](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-regexp.html))\n### End", "source_file": "/home/jaro/trainer/sources/datafusion-functions-json/README.md", "source_repo": "datafusion-functions-json", "generated_at": "2025-07-09T09:53:29.428738"}
{"question": "What is the purpose of using `json_get` instead of directly accessing a key on the JSON string?", "answer": "The main difference between directly accessing a key on a JSON string and using `json_get` lies in how errors are handled. When you access a key directly, if that key does not exist in the JSON string, Python will raise a `KeyError`. However, `json_get` returns `null` instead of throwing an exception when it can't find the key.\n\n    Here is an example to demonstrate this:\n```\n>>> json_string = '{\"name\": \"John\", \"age\": 30}'\n>>> json_string.get(\"city\")\nNone\n\n>>> json_contains(json_string, \"city\") # Returns False\nFalse\n\n>>> json_get(json_string, 0) # This would raise an error\n```\n\n    Using `json_get` is particularly useful when working with JSON strings that are expected to be malformed. You can then decide how to handle the case where a key is missing.\n\n    Best practice: When working with JSON data, it's often better to err on the side of caution and use `json_get` instead of direct access.\n\n    Related concept: `json_contains`, which checks if a specific key exists in a JSON string.\n  }\n### End", "source_file": "/home/jaro/trainer/sources/datafusion-functions-json/README.md", "source_repo": "datafusion-functions-json", "generated_at": "2025-07-09T09:53:30.964928"}

{"question": "What is the difference between `json_get` and `operator` when used on a JSON string or array, and how do they affect the rewritten SQL query?", "answer": "The `on: str, keys: str int)` function gets the length of a JSON string or array. However, there are two related but distinct concepts here: `json_get` and `operator`.\n    \n    **`json_get`**: This is an alias for the `[x]` operator. It's used to extract a value from a JSON object. When you use `json_get` with a cast expression, like `sql select from foo where json_get(attributes, bar)::string`, it will be rewritten to `sql select from foo where json_get_str(attributes, bar)`.\n    \n    **`operator`**: This is an alias for the `[x]` operator. It's used to get the length of a JSON string or array. In this context, `on: str, keys: str int)` uses the `operator` syntax because it returns the length of a value, not an entire object.\n    \n    To illustrate the difference, consider the following examples:\n    \n    ```\nsql\nSELECT * FROM json_test;\n```\n    \n    This will return all rows from the table containing JSON data.

Always validate your input using `json_valid` first.\n\n    Related concepts: For more information on working with JSON data in Python, see the official Python documentation on the `json` module.\n### End", "source_file": "/home/jaro/trainer/sources/datafusion-functions-json/README.md", "source_repo": "datafusion-functions-json", "generated_at": "2025-07-09T10:36:05.271819"}
