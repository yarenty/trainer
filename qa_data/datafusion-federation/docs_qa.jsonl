{"question": "How can I implement query federation to connect multiple databases using DataFusion?", "answer": "Query federation allows you to combine data from multiple sources into a single, unified view. In DataFusion, we provide a framework for implementing this concept.\n\n    First, let's define what federation entails:\n    -   A set of connected databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, Cassandra)\n    -   A mapping between the database tables and their corresponding federation table names\n    -   A way to execute queries on these federation tables\n\n    To implement federation, we can use the `datafusion-federation` framework. This framework provides a set of APIs that allow us to create a federation instance, define the connection to our databases, and register the mappings between database tables and federation table names.\n\n    Here's an example code snippet demonstrating how to create a simple federation:\n    ```code\nuse datafusion::prelude::*;\nuse datafusion_federation::{FederatedTableSource, TableProvider};\n\n// Create a new federation instance with two connected databases (MySQL and PostgreSQL)\nlet mut federation = FederatedTableSource::new(\n    &[(\"mysql\", DatabaseConnectionConfig {\n        url: \"jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydb\".to_string(),\n        username: \"user\",\n        password: \"password\",\n    }),\n     (\"postgresql\", DatabaseConnectionConfig {\n        url: \"jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/postgresdb\".to_string(),\n        username: \"user\",\n        password: \"password\",\n    })],\n);\n\n// Register the mappings between database tables and federation table names\nfederation.register(\n    TableProvider::new(\n        Some(\"mysql\"),\n        vec![\"my_table\"],\n        MyTableSource,\n    ),\n    TableProvider::new(\n        Some(\"postgresql\"),\n        vec![\"other_table\"],\n        OtherTableSource,\n    ),\n);\n\n// Create a new query that joins the federation tables\nlet query = Query::simple(\n    |c| {\n        c.select(&[\"column1\", &\"column2\"])\n            .from(&federation)\n            .join(MyTableSource, MyColumn, OtherTableSource, OtherColumn);\n    },\n    &mut vec![],\n);\n\n// Execute the query and print the results\nlet plan = federation.get_query_plan(query).unwrap();\n// ...\n```\n    In this example, we create a new federation instance with two connected databases (MySQL and PostgreSQL). We then register the mappings between database tables and federation table names. Finally, we create a new query that joins the federation tables.\n\n    Best practices:\n\n    *   Always use proper error handling when working with external databases.\n    *   Make sure to regularly check your federation configuration for accuracy and completeness.\n    *   Use DataFusion's built-in logging features to monitor federation performance and identify potential issues.\n\n    Common pitfalls:\n\n    *   Incorrectly configured database connections or federation mappings can lead to errors or data inconsistencies.

By letting each federation provider define its own optimizer rule, we can tailor the optimization process to the specific capabilities of each database.\n\n To prioritize table scans over index seeks, you would need to modify the optimizer rule to favor `FederatedTableSource` instances. Here's an example:\n```\ntrait FederatedProvider {\n    fn optimize_rule(&self, sub_plan: &Plan) -> Plan;\n}\n\nstruct MyProvider;\n\nimpl FederatedProvider for MyProvider {\n    fn optimize_rule(&self, sub_plan: &Plan) -> Plan {\n        // Check if the sub-plan contains a FederatedTableSource\n        if let Some(table_source) = sub_plan.iter().find(|source| source.is_federated()) {\n            // Prioritize table scans over index seeks\n            return plan {\n                ...sub_plan,\n                plan_entries: sub_plan.plan_entries.map(|entry| match entry {\n                    Entry::Scan(_) => entry,\n                    Entry::Seek(_) => {\n                        // Replace seek with scan if the database supports it\n                        let db = get_database_table_source(&table_source);\n                        if db.supports_scan() {\n                            Scan(entry.index, entry.filter, entry.partitioning)\n                        } else {\n                            Seek(entry.index, entry.filter, entry.partitioning)\n                        }\n                    }\n                }),\n            };\n        }\n\n        // If no FederatedTableSource is found, use the default optimizer rule\n        sub_plan\n    }\n}\n```\nThis modified optimizer rule would prioritize table scans over index seeks when a `FederatedTableSource` is present in the sub-plan.

{"question": "What is the purpose of registering a FederationOptimizerRule in DataFusion SessionState, and how does it impact table federation?", "answer": "\"\"\n  The purpose of registering a FederationOptimizerRule in DataFusion SessionState is to enable automatic sub-plan identification for federated tables. This rule plays a crucial role in identifying the correct sub-plans that can be used to federate tables from different providers.\n  \n  When a FederationOptimizerRule is registered, it takes into account the FederatedTableProviderAdaptors used in the table providers. These adapters are responsible for handling the federation process and ensuring that the necessary data is retrieved from the corresponding FederationProvider.\n  \n  To illustrate this, let's consider an example:\n  \n  ```code\n  // Create a DataFusion session with default_session_state\n  val session = SessionState.defaultSessionState()\n  \n  // Register the FederationOptimizerRule\n  val rule = FederatedTableSource.FederationOptimizerRule()\n  session.registerOptimizationRule(rule)\n  ```\n  \n  In this example, we create a DataFusion session using the `default_session_state` and then register the FederationOptimizerRule. This allows us to leverage the optimization capabilities of the rule for federating tables.\n  \n  Best practices:\n  - When registering a FederationOptimizerRule, make sure to use the correct type of table provider (e.g., FederatedTableProviderAdaptor) to ensure that the rule can identify the correct sub-plans.\n  - Regularly review and update your registered optimization rules to ensure they remain relevant and effective.\n  \n  Common pitfalls to avoid:\n  - Failing to register the FederationOptimizerRule, which can result in poor performance or incorrect federation results.\n  - Using incompatible table providers with FederatedTableProviderAdaptors, which can lead to errors or inconsistencies.\n  \n  Related concepts:\n  - FederatedTableSource trait: This trait provides a way to look up the corresponding FederationProvider for a given table provider.\n  - FederationOptimizerRule: This rule takes into account the FederatedTableProviderAdaptor and identifies the correct sub-plans for federating tables.\n  - DataFusion SessionState: This is where optimization rules are registered and executed.", "source_file": "/home/jaro/trainer/sources/datafusion-federation/README.md", "source_repo": "datafusion-federation", "generated_at": "2025-07-10T05:15:26.438730"}
{"question": "How can I use the FederatedTableProviderAdaptor's fallback mechanism to switch between different remote execution contexts, such as multiple MySQL instances?", "answer": "The FederatedTableProviderAdaptor's fallback mechanism allows you to fall back to a vanilla TableProvider in case the FederationOptimizerRule isn't registered. To use this feature, you can create an instance of the FederatedTableProviderAdaptor and pass it a compute_context object that provides a unique remote execution context for your use case.\n\n    For example, if you want to use multiple MySQL instances, you can create a compute_context object that returns different database schemas, access levels, or other relevant information:\n```\nconst mysqlInstance1 = {\n  db: 'mysql://user:password@localhost/db',\n  schema: 'my_schema',\n  accessLevel: 'admin'\n};\n\nconst mysqlInstance2 = {\n  db: 'mysql://user:password@localhost/db',\n  schema: 'my_schema_2',\n  accessLevel: 'moderator'\n};\n\nfunction computeContext() {\n  return mysqlInstance1; // or mysqlInstance2, etc.\n}\n\n// Create an instance of the FederatedTableProviderAdaptor\nconst provider = new FederatedTableProviderAdaptor(\n  new ComputeContext(computeContext),\n  new TableProvider()\n);\n\n// Use the provider to execute queries\nprovider.executeQuery('SELECT * FROM my_table');\n```\n    In this example, the compute_context object returns a different database schema and access level for each instance. The FederatedTableProviderAdaptor then uses these contexts to differentiate between remote execution environments.\n\n    Best practices:\n\n* Make sure to properly configure your FederationOptimizerRule to enable the fallback mechanism.\n* Use a consistent approach to creating unique compute_context objects across all instances of your application.\n* Be mindful of any performance implications associated with using multiple compute_contexts.\n\nCommon pitfalls to avoid:\n\n* Forgetting to register the FederationOptimizerRule or configuring it incorrectly, leading to unexpected behavior.\n* Using the same compute_context object for all instances, which can lead to confusion and inconsistencies.\n\nRelated concepts or alternatives:\n\n* The FederationProvider is a key component of the FederatedTableProviderAdaptor, providing access to optimization rules and computation contexts.

It then uses a custom hook to send a request to GitHub's API to create a new commit access token for the current repository.\n\n    Best practices:\n    \n    * Make sure to add the necessary permissions to your `github_token` secret.\n    * You may need to configure additional settings in your GitHub repository to allow this workflow to run successfully.\n\n    Common pitfalls:\n    \n    * Make sure that the custom hook is properly configured and tested before deploying it to production.\n    * Be aware of the potential security implications of using a custom hook to create commit access tokens.\n\n    Related concepts or alternatives:\n    \n    * For more information on GitHub Actions, see [the official documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/get-started-with-github-actions).\n    * You can also use other third-party tools, such as `git hooks`, to automate certain tasks in your Git workflow.", "source_file": "/home/jaro/trainer/sources/datafusion-federation/README.md", "source_repo": "datafusion-federation", "generated_at": "2025-07-10T05:15:33.505362"}
