{"question": "What is the difference between json_get, json_as_text, and json_contains, and how are they used in a query?", "answer": "The `json_get`, `json_as_text`, and `json_contains` functions are all used to manipulate JSON data, but they serve different purposes.\n\n    `json_get` is an operator that extracts a value from a JSON string or array. It can be used to retrieve specific values or fields from a JSON document. For example:\n    ```\n    json_get(attributes, bar) :: string\n    ```\n\n    This will extract the value of the `bar` field from the `attributes` JSON document and return it as a string.\n\n    On the other hand, `json_as_text` is an operator that converts a JSON object or array to its text representation. For example:\n    ```\n    json_as_text(attributes) :: text\n    ```\n\n    This will convert the `attributes` JSON object to its text representation, which can be useful for debugging or logging purposes.\n\n    Finally, `json_contains` is a query operator that checks if a JSON string contains another substring. For example:\n    ```\n    json_contains_str(attributes, bar) :: boolean\n    ```\n\n    This will check if the `attributes` JSON document contains the substring `bar` and return true if it does, false otherwise.\n\n    Best practices:\n\n* Use `json_get` when you need to extract specific values from a JSON document.\n* Use `json_as_text` when you need to convert a JSON object or array to its text representation.\n* Use `json_contains` when you need to check if a JSON string contains another substring.\n\n    Common pitfalls to avoid:\n\n* Make sure to escape any quotes in your JSON data using double backslashes (\\\\).\n* Be careful when using `json_get` and `json_as_text`, as they can return null values if the specified field does not exist.\n* Use `json_contains` with caution, as it can return false positives if the substring is present in a field that is not intended to be searched.\n\n    Related concepts:\n\n* JSON parsing and manipulation\n* SQL query operators for working with JSON data", "source_file": "/opt/ml/trainer/sources/datafusion-functions-json/README.md", "source_repo": "datafusion-functions-json", "generated_at": "2025-07-08T02:00:31.640691"}
