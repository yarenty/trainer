{"question": "How does the instrumented-object-store crate handle span propagation and context when tracing spans across different object store implementations?", "answer": "The `instrumented-object-store` crate uses a combination of macros and annotations to instrument object stores. It automatically captures spans for all operations, making it easy to add tracing capabilities to any object store implementation.\n\n    To propagate the span context correctly, the crate relies on the `std::sync::Arc` type to share the span between different parts of the application. This allows the span to be propagated across multiple object stores without losing its context.\n\n    Here's an example of how you might use the `instrumented-object-store` crate with a custom object store implementation:\n    \n    ```rust\n    // Import necessary crates and types\n    use instrumented_object_store::{InstrumentedObjectStore, TracingSpan};\n    use std::sync::Arc;\n\n    // Create an instance of our custom object store\n    struct MyObjectStore {\n        // ...\n    }\n\n    impl InstrumentedObjectStore for MyObjectStore {\n        fn get(&self, key: &str) -> Result<String, String> {\n            // Perform operation here...\n            let span = TracingSpan::new(\"get_operation\");\n            let result = Ok(String::from(\"Result\"));\n            span.set_result(result);\n            span.finish();\n            Ok(String::from(\"Result\"))\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Create an instance of our custom object store with tracing instrumentation\n    struct MyTracedObjectStore {\n        my_object_store: Arc<MyObjectStore>,\n        tracing_span: TracingSpan,\n    }\n\n    impl InstrumentedObjectStore for MyTracedObjectStore {\n        fn get(&self, key: &str) -> Result<String, String> {\n            // Use the tracing span to capture operations\n            self.tracing_span.start();\n            let result = self.my_object_store.get(key);\n            self.tracing_span.set_result(result).finish();\n            result\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Create a new instance of our traced object store\n    fn main() -> Result<(), String> {\n        let my_traced_object_store = MyTracedObjectStore {\n            my_object_store: Arc::new(MyObjectStore {}),\n            tracing_span: TracingSpan::new(\"traced_operation\"),\n        };\n\n        // Call the get method on our traced object store\n        let result = my_traced_object_store.get(\"key\");\n        \n        Ok(())\n    }\n  }\n}", "source_file": "/home/jaro/trainer/sources/datafusion-tracing/instrumented-object-store/README.md", "source_repo": "datafusion-tracing", "generated_at": "2025-07-10T05:21:30.524873"}

{"question": "How can I customize the instrumentation prefix for spans when using OpenTelemetry with this object store?", "answer": "The `instrument_object_store` function allows you to pass a custom prefix for span names when working with OpenTelemetry.

This is done by mapping over each record in the batch, converting its fields to strings using the `to_string()` method, and then formatting the resulting output into a compact and pretty string.\n\n```markdown\nlet batch = RecordBatch { ... };\npretty_format_compact_batch(batch, 64, 3, 10).map(fmt => fmt.to_string())\n```\n\nThis step is crucial in making the generated batch more readable and easier to analyze. The `compact` argument determines how many bytes are used for each field, while the `3` and `10` values specify the precision of the output.\n\nBest practice: Always include formatting functions when working with data formats like this to ensure readability and maintainability.\n\nCommon pitfalls:\n\n* Forgetting to format the batch can result in unreadable or difficult-to-parse records.\n* Incorrectly setting the compression levels can lead to slow performance and wasted storage space.\n\nRelated concepts:\n\n* Data formats (e.g., Apache Parquet, Apache Arrow)\n* Data processing pipelines\n* Data analysis and visualization tools", "source_file": "/home/jaro/trainer/sources/datafusion-tracing/README.md", "source_repo": "datafusion-tracing", "generated_at": "2025-07-10T05:21:52.952958"}

{"question": "How can I troubleshoot the 'Unexpected empty work table' error that occurs when instrumenting recursive query execution in DataFusion?", "answer": "# Understanding Recursive Query Execution in DataFusion\n\n    The issue you're encountering is due to a current limitation in DataFusion. When trying to instrument nodes involved in recursive query execution, the framework can break this recursion and result in errors.\n\n    ## Code Example: Instrumenting a Node in Recursive Query Execution\n    ```code\n    // Create a sample table with recursive references\n    CREATE TABLE example_table (\n        id INT,\n        parent_id INT\n    );\n\n    -- Insert some data\n    INSERT INTO example_table (id, parent_id) VALUES (1, NULL);\n    INSERT INTO example_table (id, parent_id) VALUES (2, 1);\n\n    // Instrument the node for recursive query execution\n    SELECT * FROM example_table;\n    ```\n\n    This code creates a sample table with a recursive reference and attempts to instrument it using DataFusion. However, due to the limitation, this will result in an error.\n\n    ## Workaround: Use Upstream Support\n\n    Until upstream support is available, you can try to bypass instrumentation for specific nodes involved in recursive query execution. For example, you could create a separate view that instruments only the necessary parts of the query plan:\n\n    ```code\n    -- Create a view that instruments only the necessary parts of the query plan\n    CREATE VIEW instrumented_query AS\n    WITH RECURSIVE recursive_query AS (\n        SELECT * FROM example_table WHERE parent_id IS NULL\n        UNION ALL\n        SELECT t.* FROM example_table e JOIN recursive_query r ON e.parent_id = r.id\n    ) SELECT * FROM recursive_query;\n    ```\n\n    This workaround allows you to still collect metrics and trace the query plan, but it may not provide all the insights you'd like.\n\n    # Best Practices and Considerations\n\n    When working with DataFusion, it's essential to keep in mind that instrumentation can break recursive query execution. To avoid this issue:\n\n*   Use upstream support whenever possible\n*   Create separate views or functions that instrument only the necessary parts of your query plan\n*   Test thoroughly to ensure your code works around the limitation\n\n    # Common Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n    *   Don't try to instrument nodes involved in recursive query execution without proper support.\n    *   Be aware of the limitations and workarounds available.\n\n    # Related Concepts or Alternatives\n\n    *   For more information on DataFusion instrumentation and recursion, refer to [issue 5](https://github.com/datafusion/datafusion/issues/5).\n    *   Consider using alternative data processing frameworks that don't have this limitation, such as Apache Beam or AWS Glue.", "source_file": "/home/jaro/trainer/sources/datafusion-tracing/README.md", "source_repo": "datafusion-tracing", "generated_at": "2025-07-10T05:21:58.529685"}

You can customize this setup based on your application's needs.\n\n    When it comes to integrating with DataDog, you'll need to install the DataDog SDK and set up your API key and endpoint. Here's an example of how you might do this:\n    \n    ```python\nimport datadog\n\n# Set up your API key and endpoint\ndatadog_api_key = \"YOUR_API_KEY\"\ndatadog_endpoint = \"https://app.datadoghq.com/api/v1\"\n\n# Create a new trace client\ntrace_client = datadog.TraceClient(datadog_api_key, datadog_endpoint)\n\n# Define a function to send traces to DataDog\ndef send_to_datadog(trace):\n    # Send the trace to DataDog\n    response = trace_client.send_trace([trace])\n    \n    # Check for any errors\n    if response['status_code'] != 200:\n        print(f\"Error sending trace to DataDog: {response['error_message']}\")\n```\n\n    You'll need to customize this code based on your specific use case.
