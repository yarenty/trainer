# Create a model that fits under 4GB,


1. Model Size (Parameter Count)

Llama 3.1-8B (8 billion parameters) is too large to fit a full-precision (FP16/FP32) model under 4GB VRAM, even when quantized to 4-bit.
Smaller models (e.g., 3B, 2B, or 1B parameter models) are more likely to fit under 4GB, especially when quantized.


2. Quantization

Quantizing to 4-bit (q4_k_m, q4_0, etc.) drastically reduces memory usage.
For Llama 2/3 7B/8B, 4-bit quantization typically brings the model size to ~3.5–4.5GB, which is right at the limit for a 4GB GPU (and may still OOM due to overhead).  
6B or smaller models are much safer for 4GB GPUs.

3. Sequence Length

Reducing the max sequence length (context window) can reduce memory usage during inference, but not the model file size.


4. Tokenizer and Overhead

The GGUF file includes the model weights and tokenizer. The tokenizer is small, but overhead can push a model just over the 4GB mark.

5. Best Practices for 4GB GPUs

- Choose a smaller base model (e.g., Llama 3 3B, Mistral 3B, TinyLlama, Phi-2, etc.).
- Quantize to 4-bit (q4_k_m or similar).
- Use GGUF format for llama.cpp/Ollama.
- Test with nvidia-smi or similar to confirm actual VRAM usage.


6. How to Check

After quantization, check the size of your .gguf file!  
For 4GB GPUs, the file should be well under 4GB (ideally 3.5GB or less).


## SUMMARY
| Model Size|	4-bit Quantized GGUF |	4GB GPU Compatible?|
|----|----|----|
|7B/8B	|~3.5–4.5GB	|Maybe (tight)
|3B	|~1.8–2.2GB	| Yes
|1B	|<1GB	| Yes

**Recommendation:**

For reliable 4GB GPU use, switch to a 3B or smaller model and quantize to 4-bit.
